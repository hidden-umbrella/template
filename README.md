# Kasa

## Template

- Replace words that are "Kasa" or "Template" with whatever the project name is.
- Always make sure the primary branch name is "main".
- Branch protections should be on for the main branch.
- Remove the "--dry-run" from .gitlab-ci.yml (Enables npm publishing)
- Don't forget to remove this part too!
